A group of makers gathered for our usual every-other-Wednesday meeting.  Some of the folks we met at the open house last weekend joined us.  We discussed our organization's mission and brainstormed ways to grow the group.  We also had a rousing conversation about portable devices to aid law enforcement, such as gunshot direction finding and sensory augmentation/motion detection.  We talked about the rapidly shrinking cost of resin/SLA 3D printers like the SparkMaker as well.  If there is enough interest, we may look into purchasing one for the space.  As always, this will be driven by member requests.

Check our calendar for upcoming events.  We should be adding even more soon!
