On Thursday, October 26, 2017, we discussed projects and brainstormed next steps for some of them. One of our members is working on using a tv screen like a large-scale e-reader for the vision impaired. Then we answered questions about the Python programming language. This discussion focused primarily on idiosyncracies in Python syntax relative to other common programming languages.
